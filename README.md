# flask-config-parser
An assignment Flask project to demo parsing and backing up of config files.

## Question 3
In DevOps, automating configuration management tasks is essential for maintaining consistency and managing infrastructure efficiently.

●       The program should read a configuration file (you can provide them with a sample configuration file).

●       It should extract specific key-value pairs from the configuration file.

●       The program should store the extracted information in a data structure (e.g., dictionary or list).

●       It should handle errors gracefully in case the configuration file is not found or cannot be read.

●       Finally save the output file data as JSON data in the database.

●       Create a GET request to fetch this information.

Sample Configuration file: 

[Database]

host = localhost

port = 3306

username = admin

password = secret

 

[Server]

address = 192.168.0.1

port = 8080

 

Sample Output: 

Configuration File Parser Results:

Database:

- host: localhost

- port: 3306

- username: admin

- password: secret

 

Server:

- address: 192.168.0.1

- port: 8080 




## Solution - API Endpoints
`/` : Returns the config data as json
- if both configs (.config or .yaml) have same data, they would be considered as same
